	<h3>Introduction</h3>
	<p>
Teaching is one of the hardest jobs that we could ever do in our life.We are molding a child’s character, 
intellectual, emotional and apply the learning in life. <br>In practice teaching, 
future teachers are being trained first to become effective and efficient, letting them 
experience what are waiting ahead. It never been easy,<br> future teachers need to become 
flexible. Need to know how to manage their time.Need to strive hard, to practice and 
strengthen their patients,to build their character.  <br>The school need to prepare them 
for the life of being a teacher.  
</p>
	<h3>Opening Prayer</h3>
<p>
Heavenly Father, we worship and magnify Your Holy name. 
Thank You for everything that You have done in our lives. 
Thank You for always giving us strength and peace in the journey that we are taking. 
Thank You for all Your promises God. Truly You are the God who is faithful to His children. 
Father bless us, we declare Your favor, Your love, peace and joy to our life. We declare for Your protection. 
We are praying for the shield of the Holy Spirit in our lives. 
We speak miracles and wonders in Jesus name. 
As we continue our journey, guide us God and lead us to Your promises. 
Strengthen our faith more and make us deeper into your love. We entrust everything 
into Your hands God. We declare Jeremiah 29:11, Romans 8:28, Philippians 1:6 
and Philippians 4:13 every days of our life. We know that You will never put 
us into a place with an empty-handed. Bless us again Lord. For Yours is the 
kingdom and the Glory for ever and ever. Again we bring back all the glory and 
praises to You God. We love You and we love one another. In Jesus mighty name, Amen!
</p>
	<h3>Retrospection</h3>
<p>
As I think about my experience from the very beginning 
when reality hit me so hard about me being a teacher one 
day, I can say that it’s too hard, it needs patients, it 
needs perseverance, and it needs passions to keep on the 
field I am taking. I learned so much things, how to treat 
everyone as a family, how to strive hard to build the character 
standard of being a teacher, how to think wisely before making a 
decision. All of those make sense when I enrolled the practice teaching 
subject. I find it so hard to have a practice teaching online. It is 
very hard to build a relationship to the students of your cooperating 
teacher. The new normal literally makes me exhausted and drained but 
also got my attention to the challenge it offers me. It taught me about 
the things should do in e-learning. It has a big difference in having face-to-face
 class. I learned so many things about being a teacher from the encouragement 
 of Ma’am Rhismane Montejo where telling us to enjoy the process to become a good 
 teacher, Doc. Jonel Victoria where his word strike me and make me realize that 
 the voice of the teacher is very important. It makes me conscious very time. 
 It helps me to take care of my voice because I need it as long as I teach. 
 I am really grateful. I am also thankful to my cooperating teacher, 
 Sir Arci Manangan for always giving his support and give me advice how to handle students, 
 though sometimes I am struggling because I did not meet his expectation but he 
 keeps on encouraging me to continue and learn from my experience. 
 I never forget the time where he said that I need to build a humoristic 
 characteristic in me because it gives big impact to students, he encourage 
 me to step out of my comfort zone and start practicing humor. 
 I really appreciate these three people who never give up on helping me 
 to improve as I am taking my journey as a practice teacher.
